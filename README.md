# cs231n-Assignments
My implementations of stanford cs231n:Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition(Spring 2017) assignments
I've changed some of the provided codes which can't work on my computer:<br>
In assignment 3, the code provided to show the coco dataset can't work and returned a [WinError 32]: "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.". So I changed the function 'image_from_url' in the file image_utils.py.
